      <description>Problem Statement Drug discovery and development pipeline is resource-intensive and time-consuming, which make them a major obstacle for rapid drug development. Current challenge is to develop discovery pipelines that can identify promising drug compounds early. A reliable method that can identify the potential drug compound with respect to its successful clinical translatability is needed today.
Objectives  Established a prototype pipeline to rank potential drug compounds for drug discovery to reduce the time and costs of drug development.</description>

      <description>Abstract Tackling climate change and alleviating air pollution emerge as the top agendum of the global community, so we are interested in studying pollution-related time series data to look for some insights. The data we are looking into is PM2.5 data of five Chinese cities provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. PM2.5, referring to atmospheric particulate matter with less than 2.5 micrometer, is one of the common pollutants from power plants and automobiles.</description>
