      <description>Established a prototype pipeline to rank potential drug compounds for drug discovery to reduce the time and costs of drug development. Calculated PubChem Fingerprints using PaDEL-Descriptor. Built machine learning models(decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, SVM, DNN, LSTM) for molecular structure analysis to predict compounds’ bioactivity toward selected targets. Built a client-facing API using Django.  Link to GitHub Repository</description>
