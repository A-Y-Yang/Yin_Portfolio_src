My name is Yin. I have worked as a biomedical researcher for almost five years. By a beautiful accident opportunity touch the bioinformatics through my job. I was amazed by the power and attractive in data. So I made a bold decision to start my journal to be a data science. Now, I am a master's student in Data Science who are graduating this year and seeking a data-related job opportunity to 貢獻 and expand my skillset.
