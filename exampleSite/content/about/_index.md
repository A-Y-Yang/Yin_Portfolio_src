My name is Yin. I have worked as a biomedical researcher for nearly five years. In my work, there was an opportunity to expose me to bioinformatics, and the power of data amazed me. Therefore, I started a new path towards Data Science. While this is a drastic change, I treasure my experience as a scientific researcher, which shaped my characteristics with curiosity, creativity, and detail-oriented spirits, making me a more trustworthy data scientist. Now, I am a master's student in Data Science and will graduate this year. I am seeking data-related job opportunities to apply my knowledge and expand my data skillset.
