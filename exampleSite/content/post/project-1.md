title: "Project I: Drug Target Identification"
---

* Established a prototype pipeline to rank potential drug compounds for drug discovery to reduce the time and costs of drug development.
* Calculated PubChem Fingerprints using PaDEL-Descriptor.
* Built machine learning models(decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, SVM, DNN, LSTM) for molecular structure analysis to predict compoundsâ€™ bioactivity toward selected targets.
* Built a client-facing API using Django.
